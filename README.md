# PasswordManager (pwmg)

Password Manager helps you to remember your passwords. It can save your
credentials password-encrypted on your hard drive and keeps them secure.
With PWMG you only have to remember one password, while keeping the 
advantage of having different passwords for different accounts.

## Compiling

Compiling is really easy, as no further libraries are needed. You just have to 
clone the repository and compile the classes in the src folder using javac and 
pack them in a jar-archive or just setup a Eclipse project using the src 
folder as its source folder and run that.

## Documentation

You can find a documentation of the source code in the Markdown file `doc.md`.
